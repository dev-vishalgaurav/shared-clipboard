# shared-clipboard
This application aims to provide a platform that makes it easy to transfer text from a computer to a smartphone using the standard copy/paste feature. The user enables the platform with a simple enable/disable switch; once enabled, whatever text the user copies on their computer is copied to the clipboard, and transferred to the smartphone over the cloud. A notification on their smartphone informs the user that a text is on the clipboard and can be pasted wherever desired on the smartphone.
